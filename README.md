# seismic-tomography-toolkit

This GitHub repository houses a powerful Streamlit-based application designed specifically for processing seismic velocity data. The current version of the toolbox offers an exceptional feature: 3D seismic tomogram gridding. The application leverages the Streamlit framework to provide a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both experts and enthusiasts in the field of seismology.

## Key Features:
### Seismic Tomogram Gridding: 
The current version of the toolbox enables users to efficiently process seismic velocity data by performing 3D tomogram gridding. This feature aids in visualizing and analyzing the subsurface velocity structure, offering valuable insights into geological formations.

## Upcoming Developments:
The development of this repository does not halt here. The roadmap for the future includes the integration of additional tools to further enhance seismic velocity data processing capabilities. The following features are planned for upcoming versions:

### Seismic Waveform Stacking: 
This feature will facilitate the stacking of seismic waveforms to enhance signal-to-noise ratio, enabling better identification and interpretation of seismic events. The toolbox will provide efficient algorithms for waveform stacking, empowering users to derive meaningful insights from their seismic data.

### Relative Velocity Change (dv/v) Inversion: 
The upcoming versions will introduce a powerful tool for performing relative velocity change inversion (dv/v inversion). This technique allows users to estimate variations in seismic velocity, providing crucial information about subsurface structures and potential fluid migration pathways.

We welcome contributions from the community, be it bug fixes, new feature implementations, or suggestions to improve the overall functionality of the toolbox. Together, we can build an indispensable resource for seismic velocity data processing, empowering researchers and practitioners in their exploration and understanding of the Earth's subsurface.

Get involved, collaborate, and let's unlock the secrets of the underground with Seismic Tomography Toolkit!
